Fullstack Tech E-Commerce Website (Laptops & Tech)
📌 Project Overview:
Build a full-featured, production-ready e-commerce web application for selling laptops and other tech products. This should include both user-facing features (like browsing, searching, and purchasing) and a fully functional, secure admin dashboard for managing products.

🧰 Technology Stack:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Python Flask

Database: SQLite (for development)

Image Storage: Local filesystem (/uploads folder)

UI Libraries (optional): Bootstrap or TailwindCSS

Page Rendering: Jinja2 templates via Flask routes

API Communication: fetch() or AJAX from frontend to Flask backend

✅ Functional Requirements:
🏠 Homepage (/)
Banner/hero section with animation (fade-in, zoom, etc.)

Featured products section (fetched dynamically from backend)

Navigation bar with links:

Home

Products

Search

Cart

Admin Login

🛍️ Products Listing Page (/products)
Grid layout showing:

Product image

Title

Short description

Price

Hover animations

Clicking a product navigates to /product/<id>

📄 Product Detail Page (/product/<id>)
Displays:

Large product image

Full description & specs

Price

“Add to Cart” button stores product in frontend cart (localStorage or in-memory JS array)

🔍 Search (/search?q=term)
Navbar includes a search field

Results are dynamically fetched from /api/search?q=term

Display products that match the query (by name or category)

🛒 Cart Page (/cart)
Displays all items in cart with:

Quantity controls

Delete buttons

Shows total price

“Proceed to Checkout” navigates to /checkout

💳 Checkout Page (/checkout)
Form with:

Full Name

Email

Address

Dummy payment button triggers POST request to /api/checkout

Confirmation screen shown on success (/thank-you)

🔐 Admin Panel and Dashboard (Fully Explained)
🔐 Admin Login (/admin/login)
Admin page is protected by a login system

Admin must enter a correct username and password to gain access

Credentials are stored in the database (AdminUser model) or hardcoded for development

On login:

Flask validates credentials via /api/admin/login

If valid, redirect to /admin/dashboard

If invalid, show error

🧑‍💼 Admin Dashboard (/admin/dashboard)
Only accessible if logged in as admin

Fetch and display:

Total number of products

List of all products with:

Name

Price

Category

Image thumbnail

Action buttons: Edit / Delete

🆕 Add New Product (/admin/add-product)
Form with:

Product name

Price

Description

Category

Image upload (handled via multipart/form-data)

POSTs data to /api/products

Image is saved in /uploads and URL stored in DB

❌ Delete Product
Admin clicks “Delete” → sends DELETE request to /api/products/<id>

Flask removes the product from the database and optionally deletes its image

🔄 Edit Product (optional)
Edit button shows product form pre-filled

Sends PUT request to /api/products/<id> to update info

Product:
  - id, name, price, description, category, image_url, created_at

AdminUser:
  - id, username, password_hash
Key API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Purpose
GET	/api/products	Get all products
GET	/api/products/<id>	Get one product
GET	/api/search?q=term	Search by name/category
POST	/api/products	Admin adds a product
PUT	/api/products/<id>	Admin updates a product
DELETE	/api/products/<id>	Admin deletes a product
POST	/api/checkout	Process dummy checkout
POST	/api/admin/login	Admin login authentication

Security
Protect all /admin and /api/products (POST/PUT/DELETE) routes with login

Use session-based or cookie-based authentication in development

Passwords should be hashed using werkzeug.security

🧭 Page Navigation Flow
User navigates using standard <a href=""> links or JavaScript-based routing

All templates rendered server-side with Jinja2 (Flask’s default)

Dynamic content fetched via fetch() or rendered via backend templates

Admin flow:

/admin/login → logs in

Redirects to /admin/dashboard

Can access /admin/add-product

Uses dashboard actions (edit/delete)

💡 Other Suggestions
Use dummy product data in JSON or insert into SQLite for testing

Include product categories like: Laptops, Accessories, Monitors, Storage

Admin dashboard can show stats: total products, latest added, etc.

Add toast notifications (e.g., for added-to-cart, deleted, saved)

🎯 Final Goal
A complete e-commerce platform for laptops and tech gadgets, with:

A beautiful, responsive frontend

Secure, working backend with proper data flow

Admin control over products and inventory

Functional cart, checkout, and search

All built using HTML/CSS/JS on the frontend and Python Flask on the backend with local storage for development.
