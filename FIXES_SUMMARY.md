# TECH STORE - Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Add to Cart Button Not Working ✅

**Problem**: The add to cart button was not functioning properly due to conflicting event handlers.

**Root Cause**: 
- Duplicate event listeners in `main.js` and `product_detail.html`
- The main JavaScript handler and the template-specific handler were conflicting
- The `addToCart` function was not returning a proper promise for error handling

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created a unified `handleAddToCart` function that automatically detects quantity input
- Removed conflicting event handler from `product_detail.html`
- Updated `addToCart` function to return promises for proper async handling
- Added better error handling and loading states

**Files Modified**:
- `static/js/main.js` - Fixed event handler conflicts and promise handling
- `backend/templates/product_detail.html` - Removed duplicate event handler

### 2. Admin Edit Product Functionality Missing ✅

**Problem**: Admins could only view and delete products but couldn't edit existing product details.

**Solution Implemented**:

#### Frontend Changes:
- Added "Edit" button to admin dashboard product table
- Created comprehensive edit product template (`edit_product.html`)
- Pre-populated form fields with existing product data
- Added image handling for current/new images

#### Backend Changes:
- Added `edit_product` route (`/admin/edit-product/<int:product_id>`)
- Created `handle_product_update` function for processing form submissions
- Added API endpoint for product updates (`PUT /api/products/<int:product_id>`)
- Implemented proper image file handling (delete old, save new)

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `backend/templates/admin_dashboard.html` - Added edit button
- `backend/templates/edit_product.html` - New edit product template
- `backend/app.py` - Added edit routes and API endpoints
